Tyler Inness : The Complicated Thing
  Will write about it later

***********************************************************
Name: Tim
Project Idea: <b>Dream Home</b>

The user inputs features of their dream home: 
•	Property Type: Single Family House, Townhome, Flat, etc.
•	# bedrooms
•	# bathrooms
•	Other features: e.g., pool, attached garage, large lot, in-home planetarium, etc.

The user also inputs their desired location and a price ceiling
A clustering algorithm is used to identify properties that match the user’s dream home and are sorted in that order. Depending on how fancy we wanted to get, the application could also compare the suggested dream home against previously sold properties to give the customer more information regarding the current market, etc.


Pros: 
•	relatively simple project 
•	possibility to add lots of features as we think of them

Cons: 
•	Scraping Zillow data is against that website’s terms of use, we could use other datasets (such as Melbourne housing dataset from Kaggle), but we would be limited to a static dataset.
•	The differentiator between what websites like Zillow already provide would be the clustering algorithm.
