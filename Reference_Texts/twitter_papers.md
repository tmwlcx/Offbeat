**Political Polarization:**

1. [Mapping Twitter Topic Networks: From Polarized Crowds to Community Clusters](http://www.academia.edu/download/36134639/Mapping_Twitter_networks_-_final.docx)

Summary:  ...but Polarized Crowds are not the only way that people gather on Twitter. There are at least six distinct types of conversations on Twitter based on the structure of people’s networks, the subjects and content sources that matter to them, and the way they interact. These networks have different structures that reflect the social activity within them: divided, unified, scattered, clustered, and inward and outward hub and spokes.

(this is a striking visual project/paper that maps out different conversation archetypes on Twitter)

2. [Echo Chamber or Public Sphere? Predicting Political Orientation and Measuring Political Homophily in Twitter Using Big Data](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/64/2/317/4085994)

Summary: Assesses the degree of political homophily on Twitter. Uses a combination of machine learning and social network analysis to classify users as Democrats or as Republicans based on the political content shared and assess levels of political homophily among those groups.

3. [Political Polarization on Twitter](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/viewPaper/2847)

Summary: They examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections. Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data they demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users.

**Fake Account/Content Detection:**

1. [Detecting Bots on Russian Political Twitter](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/big.2017.0038)

Summary: In this study, they develop a methodology for detecting bots on Twitter using an ensemble of classifiers and apply it to study bot activity within political discussions in the Russian Twittersphere. Among accounts actively Tweeting about Russian politics, they find that on the majority of days, the proportion of Tweets produced by bots exceeds 50%. They reveal bot characteristics that distinguish them from humans, and find that the software platform used for Tweeting is among the best predictors of bots. Finally, they find suggestive evidence that one prominent activity that bots were involved in on Russian political Twitter is the spread of news stories and promotion of media who produce them.

2. [Twitter fake account detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8093420)

Summary: In this study, they present a classification method for detecting the fake accounts on Twitter. They preprocessed their dataset using a supervised discretization technique named Entropy Minimization Discretization (EMD) on numerical features and analyzed the results of the Naïve Bayes algorithm.

3. [Faking Sandy: characterizing and identifying fake images on Twitter during Hurricane Sandy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2487788.2488033)

Summary: The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of Twitter during Hurricane Sandy (2012) to spread fake images about the disaster. They identified 10,350 unique tweets containing fake images that were circulated on Twitter, during Hurricane Sandy. They performed a characterization analysis, to understand the temporal, social reputation and influence patterns for the spread of fake images.
