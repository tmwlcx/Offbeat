1. [Music Personalization at Spotify](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2959100.2959120)

* The Spotify team dives deep into the systems they use to understand listeners, categorize and digitze song/artist information, and present relevant curated choices to each individual listener.

2. [What to play next? A RNN-based music recommendation system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8335200)

* The authors go beyond standard collaborative filtering to explore how a deep neural network may be used to measure song similarity. Tested against the Million Song Dataset, and outperformed traditional approaches.

3. [Learning Content Similarity for Music Recommendation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6213086)

* The authors combat a specific problem with collaborative filtering (it struggles with new or unpopular items) by proposing a method for optimizing content-based similarity by learning from a sample of collaborative filter data.

4. [Moodplay: Interactive music recommendation based on Artistsâ€™ mood similarity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581918301654)

*  An interactive mood-based music recommendation system is developed, which integrates content and mood data to allow users to explore music collections in an interactive way.

5. [T-RECSYS: A Novel Music Recommendation System Using Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8662028)

* The authors outline a hybrid approach that combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods as inputs to a deep learning classification model to produce accurate song recommendations.
