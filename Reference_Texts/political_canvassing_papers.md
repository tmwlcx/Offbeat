><b>TL;DR</b>: For data scientists to draw effective conclusions when using machine learning to perform causal inference, they must collaborate heavily with those having domain knowledge of social science.

><b>TL;DR</b>: Authors propose the use of a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) model to estimate a latent variable (here, campaign effort):
“MIMIC models are a variety of structural equation model where the latent variable that is considered to be the cause of the relationships among a set of indicator variables (such as campaign spending, campaign effort), that is itself caused by other, exogenous, variables (such as share of the electorate at a prior election, target seat status)”
The authors use campaign spending as a key indicator—I am not aware of anywhere we would be able to find this kind of info. Also, the article is focused on the British electoral system, but parallels to our own political system can be drawn.

><b>TL;DR</b>: Grassroots canvassing is once again very important—this article details the results of the long running American National Election Studies (ANES) data collection on grassroots canvassing from 1956-2012. The data shows the dramatic increase of grassroots efforts since 2000 provides that while early grassroots efforts were the product of local political organizing, today’s canvassing is driven by overarching strategies of national presidential campaigns. The authors suggest the increasing nationalization of campaign politics, particularly in battleground states, and consequences for American politics overall.

><b>TL;DR</b>: Contact by a campaign (through canvassing, phone call, email) does not have a statistically significant impact on candidate choice. The authors argue that even though the political system spends a lot in advertising and voter contact, the impact to votes for a candidate is nil. 
“Our argument is not that campaigns do not influence general elections in any way, but that the direct persuasive effects of their voter contact and advertising in general elections are essentially zero.”

><b>TL;DR</b>: The authors argue individual susceptibility is a much more powerful peer effect than influence. They use a hazard model to illustrate social contagion between different combinations of gender, age group, and other factors.

<b>TL;DR</b>: A proposed system for scalable visualization of geographic clustering.
