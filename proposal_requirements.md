Your proposal should generally describe:
* What you plan to do (the problem to address)
* Why you want to do it
* How you will do it (what tools? e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Kinect, iPad, etc.)
* How your approach is better than the state of the art (why it may succeed)
* When your approach succeeds, what differences will it make
* How you will measure success
* How long will it take

The proposal must answer all nine of Heilmeier's questions.

---
**Heilmeier's Questions:**
1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2. How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
3. What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?
4. Who cares?
5. If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?
6. What are the risks and payoffs?
7. How much will it cost?
8. How long will it take?
9. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured.
