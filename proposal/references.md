**Put links to papers here**

**Reminders:**

* We need three long papers or book chapters per group member (15 total)
* "Long papers" refer to typical papers published at top academic venues (e.g., KDD, CHI, ICML). They are usually at least 8-10 pages long, in 2-column format, which translate into 5000 or more words
* Short papers would be 4-5 pages or fewer, and are not worth full points
* Papers should be peer reviewed
